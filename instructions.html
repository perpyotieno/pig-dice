      <h1>RULES!!</h1>
      <p>This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100.</p>
      <p>The rules of the game are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the dice score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play.</li>
        <li>When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
        <li>When the player chooses to "hold"(pass their turn), their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
        <li>The player who first scores 100 or more points wins the game.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Try your luck!!!</p> <a href="index.html">Click to start playing</a>
